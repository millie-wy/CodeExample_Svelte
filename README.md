## Svelte Code Example

This project contain 5 simple code examples I created for my written report about Svelte.

1. Conponent Structure
2. Binding: Text/Group Inputs
3. Props
4. Slots
5. Each Blocks

Throughout my code you can also many other interesting Svelte syntax including but not limited to if blocks, svelte/transition, motion and animate.

If you have the project opened in your code editor, run the below commands in the terminal to get started.

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

... and then

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should then be running in your localhost. Alternatively you can click the below demo link!
